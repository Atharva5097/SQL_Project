# Supply Chain Analytics SQL Case Study
Optimizing Warehouse Operations & Procurement Efficiency through Advanced SQL Analytics
# üìò Project Overview
This project analyzes a simulated supply chain dataset containing customer orders, product details, suppliers, and regional sales performance. Using SQL, I performed in-depth analysis using joins, subqueries, window functions, and aggregations to generate actionable insights such as top-selling products, supplier contribution, regional performance, and customer behavior.

# üîß Tools & Skills Demonstrated
Database: SQL
SQL Techniques:
- SQL Joins and Aggregations
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, SUM OVER, etc.)
- Data Filtering, Grouping, Partitioning

# üóÉ Dataset Description
- orders ‚Äì Order-level data (status, customer, amount, date)
- order_items ‚Äì Each item within an order (product, quantity, unit price)
- products ‚Äì Product catalog (category, supplier)
- suppliers ‚Äì Supplier and region info

)
SELECT * FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY month, region;
```
# 6. Rank products by revenue within each category
#### üß† View SQL Code
```sql
SELECT *,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY p.category ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS rank_in_category
FROM (
    SELECT p.product_name, p.category, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS revenue
    FROM order_items oi
    JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY p.product_name, p.category
) ranked;
```
# 7. What is the running total of sales for each customer?
#### üß† View SQL Code
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    order_date,
    total_amount,
    SUM(total_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total
FROM orders
WHERE order_status = 'Delivered';
```
# 8. What are the top 3 suppliers by revenue contribution?
#### üß† View SQL Code
```sql
SELECT s.supplier_name, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_revenue
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN suppliers s ON p.supplier_id = s.supplier_id
GROUP BY s.supplier_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
# 9. Which month had the highest order volume?
#### üß† View SQL Code
```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS order_month, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_month
ORDER BY order_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
# 10. which are the high value customers? (>10000)
#### üß† View SQL Code
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
WHERE order_status = 'Delivered'
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 10000;
```
# 11. Find suppliers with no delivered orders?
#### üß† View SQL Code
```sql
SELECT s.supplier_name
FROM suppliers s
LEFT JOIN products p ON s.supplier_id = p.supplier_id
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
LEFT JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id AND o.order_status = 'Delivered'
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;
```
# 12. Find Compare delivered vs cancelled orders per region?
#### üß† View SQL Code
```sql
SELECT s.region, o.order_status, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN suppliers s ON p.supplier_id = s.supplier_id
GROUP BY s.region, o.order_status
ORDER BY s.region;
```

# üîç Key Insights:
- Top 5 products contribute a significant portion of total sales, indicating high product concentration.
- Delivered orders form the majority, but regions like North and East show a higher rate of cancellations.
- Certain suppliers have no delivered orders, which may indicate performance issues or inactive partnerships.
- High-value customers (‚Çπ10,000+ total spend) form a small but crucial segment‚Äîideal for loyalty targeting.
- Monthly sales trends show seasonal fluctuations, with peak sales around certain months.
- Some regions have lower average order values, hinting at pricing or product-mix misalignment.

# ‚úÖ Recommendations:
- Strengthen inventory planning for top-selling products to avoid stockouts and meet high demand efficiently.
- Audit and renegotiate contracts with underperforming suppliers to improve fulfillment rates.
- Implement loyalty programs to retain high-value customers and incentivize repeat purchases.
- Optimize marketing campaigns around peak sales months to capitalize on seasonal demand.
- Re-evaluate regional pricing strategies to increase average order value in low-performing areas.
- Monitor cancellation trends by region and product to identify root causes and reduce order failures.
